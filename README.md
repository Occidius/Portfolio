# Portfolio
An overview of created projects or Proof of Concept projects I have created while learning game design and it's basics. Each branch constitutes a unique concept, game, or mechanic that acted as the central basis for the project

NOTE: The projects "Lucidity" and "Pong" were both created and finished prior to the creation of this repository, because of this they are lacking relevant commit history prior to their current versions exports.
