# Portfolio
An overview of created projects or Proof of Concept projects I have created while learning game design and it's basics. Folders within the main branch each house a unique concept, game, or mechanic that acted as the central basis for the project. Branches are added, maintained, and merged as in-progress projects are developed.

NOTE: The projects "Lucidity" and "Pong" were both created and finished prior to the creation of this repository, because of this they are lacking relevant commit history prior to their current versions exports.
