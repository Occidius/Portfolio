Intro File for: Lucidity (CONCEPT)

This project is currently no longer in development and serves as a preliminary look into my explorations
into movement systems, physics mechanics, and using trigonometry/vector math. The initial concept for the
game titled "Lucidity" was an ever-upward-expanding linear progression platformer with segmented areas, each
with a different aesthetic or theme, featuring increasing difficulties and progressively more complicated 
level design. Eventually the project was placed on the backburner to make way for CODENAME: AMBROSIA (also visible in it's respective branch). These files and the exectuable available on (https://occidius.itch.io/) serve as a proof of concept and backbone for the core ideas of project Lucidity.

CONTROLS FOR THE GAME: 
Single downloadable which is a Godot file. Should launch the game and utilize the listed controls:
WASD - Movement, camera control via mouse/touchpad

SPACE - Jump/Double jump, double jump utilizes a 3 second cooldown

E - Speed boost, temporarily increases character speed, 1 second cooldown

R - Grapple, only functional when within 50 metes of a "Grapple Mote" 

Escape/ESC - Quit, immediately closes game window

This file is not intrinsic to the game files and can be safely removed if desired.
NOTE: THE FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY/BRANCH DO NOT CONSTITUTE A WORKING PRODUCT WITH A FUNCTIONING EXECUTABLE.
THE FILES PRESENT ARE SIMPLY TO DISPLAY THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES UTILIZED WHILE
WORKING ON THIS PROJECT.
