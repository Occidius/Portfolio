Intro File for: CODENAME: AMBROSIA

GITHUB REPO: https://github.com/Occidius/CODENAME_AMBROSIA

This repository is not housed on the current "Portfolio" repo, instead it is still mid-development in it's own dedicated Repository linked above. In this repository you can find the current state of the game design doc and any other applicable source materials. Below you can find a brief synopsis of the games plotline and various genres/characterisitcs we plan to impliment.

CONCEPT: Non-linear, item-oriented progression horror game taking place in research facility at the deepest point of the Mariana Trench.

Summoned by a highly secretive section of the U.S. Government, the (currently unnamed) player character is on a directive to connect with his brother at a submersed research station at the request of his brother for unexplained reasons. Along with Amanda Kiro, a seasoned submersible-vessel pilot and direct contact between the submersed and surface-level on-site station, the two are tasked with re-establishing a disrupted comms link and verifying the sanctity of the station, it's mission, and the mental stability of the three researchers below the sea. However, nearly immediately upon arriving, the brutal conditions of existence beneath the oceans crushing pressure, oppressive darkness, and another haunting presence soon prove to be much more difficult to handle than either of you planned...

What to expect: 
Non-linear progression: 
The planned story for the game features a linear timeline of events spliced together with flashback sequences and exposition scenes in the form of explanatory text from the Player character and various collectible texts available throughout the map. The reason for this being to allow the player to experience the world somewhat immediately, become engrossed in the mysteries present as well as their fear factor, before coming to terms with the how and why. 

Semi-Open World Map:
The player has access to wide sections of the map as well as transitional locations throughout the game. However, certain areas that may be tied to a cutscene, flashback, or other prominent event are sealed off to exploration save for a few areas the player might be able to clearly see through to the new area or via context/environmental clues. These clues hint to the player how/when they'll gain access to these areas via items, events taking place elsewhere, or allowance via an NPC. 

Item-based progression:
As mentioned prior, certain areas of the map or events might be visible but unavailable. We plan to control/enable these events while also encouraging exploration and venturing into the dark by pacing these interactions via particular items. Examples being medications to curb illnesses/symptoms blocking progress, tools needed to lift lockdowns and sanctions, codes or key details needed to repair, bypass, or undo restrictions, and in rare cases: weapons. Additionally, "combat" as it appears in this game will be designed to allow something of a safety measure to enable further exploration in the face of a dangerous situation, while not completely eliminating the threat altogether. For this reason, the weaponry will be tailored to the type of threat/fear our particular circumstances and enemies might create, as much as can be allowed by the tense setting. 

Non-Visual Focus:
Traditional horror games utilize strong visuals and jarring optical input to create fear and tension within their respsective settings. For Project Ambrosia, we aim to take the tension off the visual aspects and place special care into the auditory aspects and environmental elements. Namely, we aim to portray the danger and uncertainty of our setting through heavily augmented ambient noise and detailed sound events that create a vivid, terrifying image of the unseen.
